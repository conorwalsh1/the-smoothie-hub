# About

Welcome to Ceart (Ceart is the Irish translation of the word 'Correct'), an online multiple choice quiz for kids that tests their knowledge of the Irish language. I set out to create a quiz that is both easy to navigate and clear in it's intent.

As most people who learn the Irish language do so when they are a child, I prioritised a landing page which welcomes the site visitor using clear and easy to read English in a small paragraph with a large button that reads "Start Quiz". The welcome message informs the user that they have ten questions to answer and it also encourages the user to try again if they answer incorrectly. Once the start quiz button is clicked, the welcome message will disappear and the quiz will begin. 

The site user will be asked a question at the top of the screen under which they will have four buttons with each button containing a possible answer. If the correct button is clicked, the button selected will turn green and the "Correct" score tracker will increment by 1, however if they choose incorrectly, the button selected will turn red and the "Incorrect" score tracker will increment by 1 for each wrong answer selected

The quiz is comprised of a total of ten questions with each question being labelled with a number to show the user where they stand in terms of total questions remaining. Once the tenth question has been answered, the quiz area will be cleared of questions and answer buttons and a closing message will inform the user that they have reached the end of the quiz. The closing message will congratulate them on completing the quiz and will ask them how they fared. The user will be informed that if they would like to restart they quiz, they need only click on the little green map of Ireland thaat remains at the top of the page in the logo. Their final scores will be stored at the top of the page, showing how many answers they got correct and how many were answered incorrectly.

This website was built using a Macbook Pro 13". 

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to have fun whilst also learning more about the Irish language.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to navigate my way through the site with ease and without confusion.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if my results are improving as time goes on, getting less incorrect answers and more correct.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new questions sorted by different topics or difficulty.
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to feel that I am learning more about the Irish language as time goes on.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are grey, green, orange, black, brown and red. I used a black square with a brown boarder to create what looks like a blackboard that teachers use in Irish classrooms to make the site user feel like they are in a learning environment. I used a grey background so this blackboard would pop against it. I used the colour green for both the map of Ireland in the logo, favicon and as a transition effect if the correct answer is selected. I used white for the button backgrounds and for the writing on the blackboard. I used black for writing inside the buttons and outside the quiz area. I used red as a transition effect if the icorrect answer is selected. I used the colour combination of green, white and orange to symbolise Ireland.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The 'Coming Soon' font is used throughout the body with the only expection being that Arial is used inside the buttons as it makes them look more crisp and easy to read. I chose 'Coming Soon' as I wanted to have a font that resembled handwriting on the blackboard that would be done in chalk in a standard classroom. I feel it works very effectively. I also chose to use it for the correct and incorrect scores as it is laidback and child friendly. I chose Arial for all the buttons as it clear for the user when they want to make a decision on what the answer is.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery does not play a part on this site currently. It is a future feature that could be added to the questions. Though not technically an image, there is a map of Ireland in the logo what was created using an external logo creator called https://logomakr.com/. The quiz area blackboard does act like an image as it holds all information about the quiz within it but is not technically an image. The only images that appear in the images folders are that of the favicon, the logo, the wireframes and the responsibve test.

*   ### Wireframes

    -   I chose to use Balsamiq Wireframes to plan out how I hoped for the site to look. I will post three pictures below, showing how I wanted the start of the quiz, the quiz questions and the end of the quiz to appear.

    ![End of the Quiz](assets/images/wireframe-quiz-end.png)

    
## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes. On wider screens the questions and buttons stretch out to make use of space but on smaller screens the media queries ensure the quiz is adaptive and clean

-   Correct and Incorrect scores increment as according to users selecting the correct answer ot incorrect answer.

-   When hovered over, the 'Start Quiz' and 'Next' buttons transition to orange to encourage user to click.

-   Accessibility has been added in terms of both aria labels and aria labelled by to ensure the site is usable for anyone using screen readers.

-   The 'Next' button toggles through questions until there are no questions left to display, at which point the closing message appears on screen.

-   Ten seperate questions with different answers. If the correct answer is selected, button turns green. If incorrect button selected, button turns red.

-   Welcome message upon loading the quiz informing player how the quiz works.

-   Closing message upon completing the quiz congratulating the player, telling them how they scored and directing them to click the green map of Ireland in the logo if they would like to restart. There are four different messages that a player could receive, depending on their final score.

-   The green map of Ireland in the logo contains a link so that when it is clicked, it will refresh the page, thereby restarting the quiz.

## Features I Would Have To Add

-   Different topics of quiz questions, such as sport, history, geography.

-   Different variations of difficulty to keep site users coming back (perhaps images to accompany certain questions on an easier mode.).

-   A highscore page that stores users names and scores.

-   A timer so that players can test themselves to try and beat their previous times.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site..

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean unobstructed interface which contains the name of the site and a welcome message explaining the sites purpose.
        2. The rules of the quiz are explained clearly.
        3. The user is shown a large "Start Quiz" button which calls the function to start the quiz

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate through the quiz without any confusion.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. Once the quiz starts, the user will have an option of four different buttons to select, all of which can be pressed for each question. The 'Next' button guides the user through the quiz until they have answered all questions
        2. The user will be alerted with a closing message once all questions have been answered.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to have an experience that is meaningful and informative.

        1. The quiz has been set up in a way that the questions are not difficult but not easy either. As a first time visitor, I want to feel stimulated enough that I would like to return again.
        2. The encouraging language in the opening and closing messages is scripted in a way that aims to provoke a positive emotional reaction in the site user.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to challenge the score I received on the previous occasion.

        1. The tally for correct and incorrect score will always appear at the top of the screen. It gives the visitor a way of tracking their score so they have something to compare it against when they return.
        2. The score shows both correct and incorrect so the visitor has two ways of challenging themselves.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to complete the quiz without any distractions

        1. The quiz is set up in a way that the visitors eyes are only drawn to the quiz area which is contained in a black box with brown border.
        2. There is nothing included on the site that isn't necessary which promotes a concentrated learning environment.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to improve my Irish language skills.

        1. The site has a familiar layout which is truly unique. This allows the site visitor to focus purely on learning Irish through the quiz.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any changes to either the questions in terms of topics or difficulties.

        1. If any changes were to be implemented either through topics or question difficulties, the user would be notified in the welcome message so the landing page acts as a notice board for any changes on site.

## Credits

### Code

-   [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-a-favicon-to-your-website-with-html) : I copied the template code on this site so that my favicon would work correctly.

-   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573979/force-page-reload-with-html-anchors-html-js) : I wanted to force a page reload once the logo was clicked and I acheived this using information here.

-   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12194435/cannot-set-property-display-of-undefined) : I came across a bug stating "Cannot set display of undefined" in Dev tools. I followed an approach here to eradicate the issue.

-   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22549032/illegal-use-of-break-statement-javascript) : I was trying to use the "break" statement which I thought would end the loop generating quiz questions but it said "illegal use of break". I then researched online and found that the "return" statement was a better fit as it would break the execution flow of the function and that break was used more for 'for' or 'while' loops.

-   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3304014/how-to-interpolate-variables-in-strings-in-javascript-without-concatenation) : I used this resource to figure out how to interpolate the final score into the string of if statements that appear in the generateNextQuestion function.

-   [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLfAW55_4cY) : I followed the first part of this tutorial to acheive the desired effect of a hover olay for my buttons.

-   [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-style.asp) : I used this site as I was looking to remove a border style that was appearing dotted when I just wanted a simple plain border.

-   [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_pushbutton_disabled.asp) : I used this site as I was looking for a way to stop the correct answer button from being clicked more than once which was incrementing the score infinitely based on how many time the user clicked the same correct answer.

- My functions incrementScore and incrementIncorrectScore were taken from the 'Love Maths' Code Institute walkthrough, I replaced the Id's with my own.

### Problems Overcame

-   I found Javascript quite tough initially. When I started the project I relied heavily on a Youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&t=1374s) which created a multiple choice quiz exactly how I wanted it to look but I could not explain how any of the Javascript functions worked. I spoke with my tutor Maria who advised that the Javascript code must be custom written. I deleted the project and went back to the start of the Javascript course and I went through the modules again, this time bookmarking parts I realised I could use in my own project and thereby gaining a better understanding of JS. By the time I came through the JS module, I felt much more prepared and I started writing my own custom JS. You will be able to see in the commits where I deleted the JS code and started afresh.

-   One function I had a lot of trouble with was the correctAnswer function. I spent a number of days working different angles but I was delighted to get it working in the end. What I figured out was that I was missing was the event parameter within the function itself.

-   I kept receiving an error once the quiz came to a close, saying :

    TypeError: Cannot read property 'question' of undefined
       at generateQuestion (script.js:29)
       at HTMLButtonElement.generateNextQuestion (script.js:57)

    I kept looking through the course material and found the "break" statement which I thought would end the loop. I tried but it still wouldn't work. I then researched online and found that the "return" statement was a better fit as it would break the execution flow of the function and that break was used more for 'for' or 'while' loops.

-   When the site was being tested, a user brought to my attention that the answer buttons could be clicked infinitely, which was an issue as the correct score could be incremented above ten which was how many questions and possible correct answers were present. I went about creating a function to resolve this issue by creating one function that disabled the buttons once the correct answer was clicked and another function that reactivated the buttons once the 'Next' button was clicked. I was happy to just block the user from clicking the correct answer more than once as the quiz is built for children, I want them to feel encouraged to try again to find out what the correct answer is, even if by process of elimination.

### Acknowledgements

-   I would like to thank my mentor Maria Hynes for guiding me along the right path throughout our mentoring sessions. There were times I struggled with getting the way I wanted the code to look out of my head and onto the screen, but she gave me great motivation to persevere and I am very grateful for her assistance. I would also like to thank the tutors that helped me along the way.
